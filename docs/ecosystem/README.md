# Bolt Ecosystem — Cross-Repo Documentation

> **Updated:** 2026-02-24
> **Canonical location:** `bolt-core-sdk/docs/ecosystem/`

Workspace-level design documents that span multiple repositories in the
Bolt Protocol ecosystem. Per-repo docs live in each repo's own `docs/`
folder; this directory is for decisions that affect boundaries between repos.

Note: The `bolt-ecosystem/` workspace root is not a git repository.
The canonical, version-controlled copy of these docs lives here in
bolt-core-sdk.

## Index

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [RUST_CORE_PLAN.md](RUST_CORE_PLAN.md) | Design memo for Rust canonical core migration (crate layout, API surface, interop strategy, phased milestones) |
